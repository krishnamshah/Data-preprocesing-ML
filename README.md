# Data-preprocesing-ML
Data preprocessing function consisting of tackling missing values, duplicate columns and many more.
The function will search for missing values, tackle it. Also, checks for duplicate columns and removes if any. Finally, removes highly correlated columns.

This is a work in progress and the functions will be updated.
